# Solace-Development

# Description:
This repo is dual purposed:
1. This is meant to wholistically showcase a POC using Solace and a Raspberry Pi to control IoT devices within your home network.
2. This is meant to provide a self-service UI for you to configure a solace cloud VPN with little to no message routing experience (specifically for a single IoT instance)

# How to get started
1. Onboard to solace cloud
2. Buy and configure a Raspberry Pi
3. Configure your message router using the self-service UI
4. Pull the repo and get started

# What's next?
There is still a significant amount of work to make this productionized code.
- Proper commenting and further documentation
- Better logging for local and cloud implementations
- Monitoring and Visibility into userbase
